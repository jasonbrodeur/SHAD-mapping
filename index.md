Hello! During today's workshop, you'll work with your fellow SHADs to gather, synthesize, and spatially analyze data that will help answer the question: ***How 'livable' are McMaster's outdoor spaces for McMaster members?*** Throughout today, we'll explore this question and its connection to the concepts of sustainability, accessibility, and community.
